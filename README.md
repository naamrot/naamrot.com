# NAAMROT RULEBOOK

## Core Principles
- Only words change; punctuation and spacing stay exactly the same.
- Output is always **ALL CAPS**.
- Hyphens (`-`) and apostrophes (`'`) split words into parts, which are transformed separately and re-joined.
- Rules apply consistently across all words.
- Some words are handled as exceptions for clarity and meaning.

## Exceptions (Special Fixed Words)
These words are always converted the same way:

- **VERY → WELL**
- **WELL → WELL**
- **YOU / YOUR → YA**
- **THE → THA**
- **FOR → FA**
- **PLEASE → PALEASE**
- **DEADLINE → DODLINE**
- **MISTAKES → MOSTAKES**
- **AMINUR → AMINAH**
- **DATE → DATE**
- **NAME → NAME**
- **SET → SOT**

## Prefix Sound Rules
- **SN → SAN**  
  SNAKE → SANAKE  
  SNAGGED → SANAGGED  
  SNEAK → SANEAK  

- **SW → SAW**  
  SWIFT → SAWIFT  
  SWIRL → SAWARL  

- **RE → RO** (only when clearly pronounced “ree”)  
  RE-ENTER → RE-ONTAH  
  REASON remains unchanged  

## Consonant Cluster Expansion
Harsh starting consonant clusters are softened by inserting **A**.

- Two consonants followed by R (`__R`)  
  CHROME → CHAROME  
  SHRINK → SHARINK  

- Words starting with BR / CR / DR / FR / GR / PR / TR / BL / CL / FL / GL / PL / SL  
  BROWN → BAROWN  
  CLEAN → CALEAN  

## Internal Sound Changes
- **IR → AR**  
  SKIRT → SKART  
  THIRSTY → THARSTEH  

- **ER → AH**  
  ENTER → ENTAH  
  INTERNET → ONTAHNET  

## Ending Sound Rules
- **A → AH**  
  UTOPIA → UTOPIAH  

- **ER / UR → AH**  
  LECTURER → LOCTURAH  

- **TION → SHAN**  
  INFORMATION → INFORMASHAN  

- **TY → TEH**  
  ABILITY → ABILITEH  

- **LY / LEY → LEH**  
  QUICKLY → QUICKLEH  
  BURNLEY → BURNLEH  

- **AY → AEH**  
  DAY → DAEH  
  TODAY → TODAEH  

- **Final Y (EE sound) → EH**  
  HAPPY → HOPPEH  
  ACADEMY → OCODEMEH  

## Vowel Behaviour
- Only **A, E, I** may swap to **O**.
- Inserted vowels never change.
- If a word does not end in AH, the last vowel is protected.
- If a word has exactly four vowels, the last two vowels are protected.
- Vowel pairs like EA or IA are preserved.
